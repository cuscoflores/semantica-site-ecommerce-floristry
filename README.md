semantica-site-ecommerce-floristry
==================================

To become the site in a semantic way

This project is created to align the FLORISTRY descriptions existing in the DB with the terminology from a convenient ontology (if exists). The final objective to accomplish is: given a user viewing a flower bouquet, the ontology worked might be able to link the best description from the web for each flower that compose a bouquet.
